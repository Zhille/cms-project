·All post's have their category and that is one thing that make them different and possible to sort. If u want to sort them, the one way of doing that is by clicking at one them at navigation bar. 
·The second way of sorting post's is by post creator, if you click on any post creator name browser will bring you to page where will be displayed all the post's for that specific user.
·If you want to search some post's or one specific post you can do that by using 'blog search', for example, if you want to see only post's about PHP just type 'PHP' in search box and all post's wich have some relation about PHP will be displayed.
·In this case, web site have a lot of post's so all the post's are separated by using pagination which is dymanic pagination and number of pages deppended's of number of post's.
·For contacting support ( in this case Admin ) go to > Contact < bar, and easily send the e-mail.
